# Java-Exercise

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language.

Java is the foundation for virtually every type of networked application and is the global standard for developing and delivering embedded and mobile applications, games, Web-based content, and enterprise software.

The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise.
